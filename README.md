# Oystercard Challenge
A system emulating the behaviour of London's Oystercard infrastructure which tests skills in Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design.

## Issue notes
Review of initial error in Challenge 3:
* Type of error: NameError: uninitialized constant Oystercard
* File path where error happened: ./spec/oystercard_spec.rb.
* Line number: 1
* Ruby doc says: "Raised when a given name is invalid or undefined."
* Solve the error by creating the class Oystercard and remember to 'require' the file
